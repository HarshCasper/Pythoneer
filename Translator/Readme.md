# Translator

This is a simple Python Code which utilizes plyer, translate and pyttsx3 libraries to implement a simple Python Translator that 
can translate words and display their intended meaning in a different language by copying it and then pressing the '/' button. 
The Program can also speak aloud with the help of '*' button where it utilizes a pyttsx3 engine for generating a speech. 
However the code limits itself to translate only 64 characters at a time.
