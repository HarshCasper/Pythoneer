# Password Generator

This is a simple Python Implementation which utilizes Random and Pyperclip Module to generate a new password and then copy it onto the
Clipboard. The password is generated by looping 15 times and randomly selecting characters from the given string which is then 
concatenated and printed as well as copied to the clipboard using Pyperclip Module.
